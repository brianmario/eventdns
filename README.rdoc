= EventDns - An EventMachine based DNS server

This is a fork of brianmario's eventdns sever which uses an HTTP server as the storage backend, allowing you to keep your DNS data in the same place as your web application.

Very beta, you probably shouldn't use this, it can't do negative dns caching yet.
